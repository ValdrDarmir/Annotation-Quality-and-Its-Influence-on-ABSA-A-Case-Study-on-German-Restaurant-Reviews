## Abstract  

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) enables fine-grained evaluation of opinions by identifying not only overall sentiment but also sentiments toward specific aspects or targets within a text.
While the task has been extensively studied in English, research on German remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets.
Reliable annotations are essential for training and evaluating machine learning models, yet the quality and consistency of such data strongly depend on the annotation strategy employed.

This thesis investigates how different sources of annotation affect the development of German ABSA.
An existing dataset is re-annotated to establish a ground truth created by experts, which serves as the reference point for evaluating annotations generated by students, crowdworkers, large language models in few-shot settings and experts.
The study compares the quality of these annotations using inter-annotator agreement as a central measure, analyzing consistency across different datasets and annotator types, and examines how these differences impact downstream model performance.

The evaluation focuses on two central ABSA tasks: Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis and Target Aspect Sentiment Detection.
State-of-the-art methods, including Paraphrase, Multi-View Prompting, BERT-CLF, fine-tuned large language models and few-shot prompting approaches, are applied to assess how differences in annotation quality translate into measurable differences in model outcomes.

The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between annotation strategy, inter-annotator reliability, and model performance in ABSA, providing practical insights for the creation of annotated datasets in poor-resource languages such as German. By highlighting trade-offs between annotation reliability, efficiency, and cost, the thesis offers guidance for future work in resource construction and evaluation for sentiment analysis in German.
